**Hardpoint**
(2) Teams fight to capture designated hardpoints on the map. As players spend time on
the hardpoints their team will gain XP. While enemy players are on the hardpoint it will
be contested until only players from one team control the hardpoint. The hardpoint will
last for (30 seconds) before it moves to a different hardpoint location. Each match ends
after (5 minutes) or ends when a team reaches (260 XP = 260seconds on the hardpoints)
